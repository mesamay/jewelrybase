jewelrybase
===========

This program will keep track of jewelry made, sold, materials used and/or needed, ordering. A database for your jewelry business.

I want to make a reasonable priced program for jewerly makers which covers all their needs. One that can add pictures and be easily used. I want it to be reallly user friendly. 

I need a program like this and probably others do too. I could only find one that did half of what i want to do and I think its over $200. If i get the program to run flawless it will sale for about 50-75 dollars. Depending on how much time i have to spend on it.
